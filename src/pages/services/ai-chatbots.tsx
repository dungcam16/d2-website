  // FAQs
  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "How long does implementation take?",
      answer: "Typically 2-3 weeks. Week 1: We onboard you, gather requirements, and connect integrations. Week 2: We train the AI on your knowledge base and workflows. Week 3: Testing and refinement. Most clients go live in 14 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to provide training data? How much?",
      answer: "Yes, but it's simple. We need: (1) Your FAQ/help documentation (5-20 pages), (2) Common sales objections (10-15 points), (3) Pricing and product information (existing docs work), (4) CRM fields and structure (30 min setup call). Most clients provide this in 2-3 hours. We handle the rest."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my business is highly specialized (e.g., FinTech, Healthcare)?",
      answer: "No problem. We've worked with highly regulated industries (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS). The AI learns your domain-specific language and compliance requirements. It takes 1-2 weeks extra to set up correctly, but results are exceptional."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the AI handle complex questions or does it just answer FAQs?",
      answer: "It handles both. For simple questions (pricing, features), it answers instantly. For complex issues, it gathers information, routes to the right team, and provides context. Think of it as 'smart triage' not just a FAQ bot."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my team's productivity actually improved?",
      answer: "Our dashboard shows real-time metrics: (1) Support tickets handled by AI (automated %), (2) Average response time (before/after), (3) Leads qualified by AI, (4) Cost per interaction, (5) Customer satisfaction scores. Most clients see improvement in week 1 and ROI by day 30."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the AI says something wrong or inappropriate?",
      answer: "It's rare (happens <1% of the time), but we monitor every conversation. When we catch mistakes, we flag them and retrain the AI. You can also set guardrails: 'Don't mention competitor X' or 'Don't discuss pricing if customer asks Y.' We get smarter each week."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for sales conversations, not just support?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Many of our clients use it for: (1) Lead qualification (asking discovery questions), (2) Demo scheduling (booking calls automatically), (3) Objection handling (answering common concerns), (4) Upselling (suggesting relevant products based on conversation), (5) Re-engagement (reaching out to inactive leads). It's sales automation, not just support."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many customers can chat with the AI at once?",
      answer: "No limit. The AI handles unlimited concurrent conversations. That's the beauty of AI - it doesn't get tired or overwhelmed. 1,000 customers can chat simultaneously and get instant responses."
